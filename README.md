[Am I Productive](http://challengepost.com/software/am-i-productive) (AIP) is a [BitCamp](https://bitca.mp/) project that uses an OpenWRT router to monitor network traffic and send collected data to the AIP web application for processing. AIP maintains a report in real-time on the user's levels of productivity and procrastination based on the collected data.
