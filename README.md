# Am I Productive?

"Am I Productive?" (AIP) is a web application that reports on your productivity throughout the day. AIP was built at BitCamp, a hackathon hosted at the University of Maryland. The project uses an OpenWRT router to monitor network traffic and send collected data to the web application for processing. AIP maintains a report in real-time on the user's levels of productivity and procrastination based on the collected data.
